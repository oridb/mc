Summary
-------

As a reminder, Myrddin characters hold a single Unicode codepoint, and all
strings are assumed to be encoded in UTF-8 by default. These functions are
designed to facilitate manipuating unicode strings and codepoints.

The APIs are generally designed that strings will be streamed through, and
not encoded or decoded wholesale.

Constants
---------
    const Badchar	: char 

This is a character value that is not, and will never be, a valid unicode
codepoint. This is generally returned when we encounter an error fr 

    const Maxcharlen : size 

This is a constant defining the maximum number of bytes that a character may
be decoded into. It's guaranteed that a buffer that is at least Maxcharlen
bytes long will be able to contain any character.

    const Maxcharval : char 

This is the maximum value that any valid future unicode codepoint may decode
into. Any character that is greater than this is an invalid character.

Functions: Iterating over strings
--------------------------------

	impl iterable chariter -> char

	const chariter	: (byte[:] -> chariter)

Chariter returns an iterator which steps through a string character by
character.

Functions: Encoding and Decoding
--------------------------------

    const charlen	: (chr : char -> size)

Charlen returns the length in bytes that decoding the character provided into
unicode would take. This can vary between 1 and Maxcharlen bytes.

    const encode	: (buf : byte[:], chr : char -> size)

Encode takes a single character, and encodes it to a utf8 string. The buffer
must be at least long enough to hold the character.

Returns: The number of bytes written, or -1 if the character could not be
encoded.

    const decode	: (buf : byte[:] -> char)

Decode converts the head of the buffer `buf` to a single unicode codepoint,
returning the codepoint itself, or `Badchar` if the codepoint is invalid.

The tail of the buffer is not considered, allowing this function to be used
to peek at the contents of a string.

    const strstep	: (str : byte[:] -> (char, byte[:]))

strstep is a function for stepping through unicode encoded strings. It
returns the tuple (`Badchar`, str[1:]) if the value cannot be decoded,
or `(charval, str[std.charlen(charval):])` therwise.


```{runmyr striter}
    s = "abcd"
    while s.len != 0
            (c, s) = std.striter(s)
            std.put("next char is {}\n", s)
    ;;
```
