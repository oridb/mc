Overview
--------

Myrddin does not have exceptions. By convention, code will abort on
programmer errors, such as passing invalid values where valid ones
were expected -- for example, calling `std.fmt("{}")` with the wrong
number of arguments int the list.

For recoverable error conditions that depend on the environment, and
not the developer making a mistake, one of the branched return types
are conventionally used.

For conditions where something can be either present or not, the `option(@a)`
type is used. For places where there can be either a result or an error, the
`result(@a, @e)` type is used.

Generally, by convention, the type returned for the result should have a
custom that converts it to something directly displayable to the user.

Types
-----

    type option(@a) = union
            `Some @a
            `None
    ;;

As mentioned in the overview, `option(@a)` is a type that wraps up a result
and error type. It is typically used  in places where a missing value is the
only exceptional condition.

    type result(@a, @b) = union
            `Ok	@a
            `Fail	@b
    ;;


The type `result(@a, @e)` is used to signal either success or an error
condition. The first type parameter, `@a` is what is returned on success,
and the second, `@b` is returned on failure.


Functions
---------
    $noret const fatalv	: (fmt : byte[:], ap : valist# -> void)
    $noret const fatal	: (fmt : byte[:], args : ... -> void)

Both fatal and fatalv exit the program with an error message, formatted as
in `std.fmt`. They do not return.

They exit with a failure status. On Unix, this status is `1`. On Plan 9,
the status is the failure message that it prints out before exiting.

    const assert	: (cond : bool, fmt : byte[:], args : ... -> void)

Assert checks that condition is true. If it is not true, then the message
is printed as in `std.fmt`, and the program is aborted with `suicide()`.

    const suicide	: ( -> void)

Suicide aborts a program. It does not print any message, it simply sends
the program a SIGABRT or segfaults it. All threads are terminated, and the
program goes away.

    generic try : (v : result(@a, @b) -> @a)
    generic get : (v : option(@a) -> @a)

Try and get both return the value from the successful branch of their type:
`try` returns the value contained in `\`std.Ok`, and `get` returns the value
in `\`std.Some`.

If this does not match the union, a diagnostic message is printed and the
program is aborted.

    generic tryv : (v : result(@a, @b), default : @a -> @a)
    generic getv : (v : option(@a), default : @a -> @a)

Try and get both return the value from the successful branch of their type:
`try` returns the value contained in `\`std.Ok`, and `get` returns the value
in `\`std.Some`.

If this does not match the union, the default value is returned to the
caller, as though the type had contained `\`Some default` or `\`Ok default`
