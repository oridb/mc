Descriptions

    type instant

Instant represents a single instant of time, with a resolution
of microseconds. It contains the actual instant in the member
`actual`, which is a timestamp in microseconds since Jan 1, 1970
at 00:00 in UTC, and breaks out the "humanized" time out into the
various members that are exposed.

The instant type always has a timezone attached, and the humanized
time components are always in that timezone.

    type duration

A duration is an absolute number of microseconds that can be added
or subtracted from an instant. This is not timezone adjusted.

    type period

A period is a time delta that is adjusted for crossing timezones,
daylight savings, and other similar events. If you add a day to
an instant, you would get the same wallclock time the next day,
should that wallclock time exist.

For example, if I were to add `\`Day 2` to the instant 
`Oct 31 2015 3:00`, then the result would be the date
`Nov 2 2015 3:00`, regardless of the daylight savings time adjustment.
However, adding `\`Hour 48` would not have that effect.

In cases where the adjustment does not exist -- for example, leap years,
then the time will "wrap around" to the next available day. For example,
Feb 29th on a leap year will become Mar 1st.
