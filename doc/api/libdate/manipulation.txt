Creation
-----------

    const utcnow	: (-> instant)

Creates an instant representing the current time. The timezone is UTC. As a
general philosophical point, dates written out persisetntly should generally
be in UTC, so this function should generally be used to get dates.

Returns: An instant representing the current time in the UTC timezone.

    const now	: (tz : byte[:] -> instant)

Creates an instant representing the current time. The timezone is the local
time. This is useful for displaying dates and times to the user.

Returns: An instant representing the current time in the local timezone.

    const tozone	: (d : instant, zone : byte[:]	-> instant)

Takes an instant and converts it to a new timezone. This takes the instants by
value, and therefore, does not mutate any of its arguments.

Returns: An instant representing provided time in the requested timezone.

    const mkdate	: (y : int, m : int, day : int, zone : byte[:]	-> instant)

Creates a date with the given year, month, and day in the given timezone. The
time is set to 0:00:00

Returns: A date representing the given ymd

    const mkdatetime	: (year : int, mon : int, day : int, \
            h : int, m : int, s : int, zone : byte[:]	-> instant)

Creates a date and time pair with the given year, month, day, at the time
h, m, s, in the provided timezone. The microseconds are zeroed.

Returns: A date representing the given ymd:hms

    const mkinstant	: (tm : std.time, zone : byte[:]	-> instant)

Creates an instant from a time type. This time can be derived from the
standard library, or computed from any other source. The time is in
microseconds since the Unix epoch (Jan 1 1970, 0:00, UTC).

Returns: An instant representing a std.time in the requested timezone

Timezones
---------

    const localoff	: (tm : std.time -> duration)

Gets the local timezone offset for a time. Note that timezones can change due
daylight savings, politics, and other similar factors, so a timezone offset
needs to be associated with a specific instant.

Returns: a duration representing the local timezone offset.

    const tzoff	: (tzname : byte[:], tm : std.time	-> duration)

Gets the timezone offset for a time and timezone pair. Note that timezones can
change due daylight savings, politics, and other similar factors, so a
timezone offset needs to be associated with a specific instant.

Returns: a duration representing the requested timezone offset.

    const isleap	: (d : instant	-> bool)

Returns: whether a specific instant is within a leap year or not.

Manipulation
------------
    
    const add	: (d : instant, dt : duration	-> instant)
    const sub	: (d : instant, dt : duration	-> instant)

Adds or subtracts a duration from a date. A duration is an absolute length of
time, and is not adjusted for calendar shifts around DST and similar events.

Returns: an instant representing the adjusted time.

    const addperiod	: (d : instant, dt : period	-> instant)
    const subperiod	: (d : instant, dt : period	-> instant)

Adds or subtracts a period from a date. A period is a humanized length of
time, and is adjusted for calendar shifts around DST and similar events.

Returns: an instant representing the adjusted time.

    const duration	: (a : instant, b : instant	-> duration)

Returns: the duration representing the difference between the two provided
instants.
