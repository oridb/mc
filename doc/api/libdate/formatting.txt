Date and Time Formatting
---------------------

Formatting in libdate is done through the standard formatting
functionality, and there are actually no functions exposed by libdate.
Instead, you would write something like:

```{runmyr stdfmt1}
use date

const main = {
	std.put("{}\n", date.now())
}
```

Custom formatting is done with a format option passed to std.format that
looks like `f=dateformat`. The format strings used resemble the strings
provided in strptime. Any characters preceded with a '%' are format
characters, otherwise they are copied to the output stream directly.

The format strings used to control formatting are also used to control parsing.

An example would look like:

```{runmyr stdfmt1}
use date

const main = {
	std.put("{f=year is %Y, the day is %d}\n", date.now())
}


There are a number of short format options installed, specifically, `d`,
`D`, and `t`, which respectively map to the default date format, the
default date and time format, and the default time only format.

```{runmyr stdfmt1}
use date

const main = {
	std.put("{d}\n", date.now())
	std.put("{D}\n", date.now())
	std.put("{T}\n", date.now())
}
```

Date and Time Formatting
---------------------

Both parsing and formatting use the same format strings. The
modifiers that are supported by libdate are listed below.

When possible, the default format verbs `D`, `d`, or `t`
should be used for formatting, and the default constants
`Datefmt`, `Datetimefmt`, or `Timefmt` should be used for
parsing.
