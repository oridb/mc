# Myrddin
[Myrddin Website and Documentation](https://myrlang.org/)

Myrddin is a systems language that is both powerful and fun to use.
It aims for C like low level control, a lightweight high quality implementation,
and features you may find familiar from languages like like rust and ocaml.

This combination makes Myrddin suitable for anything ranging from desktop
applications, to embedded systems and potentially even kernel development.

## Examples
A classic:

```
use std

const main = {

	for var i = 0; i < 1000; i++
		/* pattern match on a tuple */
		match (i % 3, i % 5)
		| (0, 0): std.put("fizzbuzz\n")
		| (0, _): std.put("fizz\n")
		| (_, 0): std.put("buzz\n")
		| _:
		;;
	;;
}
```

How about regex, destructuring and algebraic data types?

```
use regex
use std

const main = {
	var re, str

	str = "match against this!"
	match regex.compile(".*")
	| `std.Ok r:	re = r
	| `std.Fail m:	std.fatal("couldn't compile regex: {}\n", m)
	;;
	match regex.exec(re, str)
	| `std.Some _:  std.put("regex matched\n")
	| `std.None:	std.fatal("regex did not match\n")
	;;
	regex.free(re)
}
```
